        <h1>Progress</h1>
        <p>So in the last few weeks I have been writing what you could call my <i>debut</i> Novel, which if you didn't know was or is pretty much what I would consider my personal favourite or even my dreaded <i>Magnum Opus.</i> Writing is never easy but by now I have managed to at least write almost 110 page's which is a fair feat, regarding my current position and situation. If you have found this blog you have probably noted that I have <i><a href="https://cyberhawksite.wordpress.com">already got a blog.</i></a> Although with this being said I intend to use this blog as a method of easing some of the eventual memory that I will use up on the wordpress site. When you consider the <i>free</i> memory you get you have to compromise. So this is in theory my compromise.</p>

        <h3>Where it stands</h3>
        <p>Where the novel stands is difficult to actually answer. I am not even half way through what I intend to get through at the moment [which may coe as a surprise]. I intend to do much much more with the project, although, it may be cut short, I hope it isn't but you never know where lfie may take you, eventually anyway.</p>
        <h3>Current Facts</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>40% way through</li>
          <li>10,946+ Words</li>
          <li>61,912+ Characters [Individual letters]</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>I am hoping to finish this project late summer, where I can at least go through a 2<sup>nd</sup> draft of the work, so I can at least get it up to scratch and polished</p>
